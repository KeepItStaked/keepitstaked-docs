The genesis.json file serves as the initial state of the blockchain when it is created. It contains critical information needed to bootstrap the network such as: '**Initial Validator Set**', '**Chain Configuration**', '**Initial Balances**', and '**Application State**'. This file must ensure your node is connected to the right network.

**Download `genesis.json` file:**
```bash
wget {{ genesis }} -O $HOME/{{folder}}/config/genesis.json
```
