# SEDA Address Book
The `addrbook.json` is the file used to store the addresses of known peers in a node's network. This file facilitates the peer discovery process, allowing nodes to identify and connect with other nodes in the network. Maintaining an updated list of peer addresses helps improve network connectivity and overall performance while dealing with other nodes within the network.

**Download `addrbook.json`:**
```bash copy
wget {{ addrbook }} -O $HOME/{{ folder }}/config/addrbook.json
```
