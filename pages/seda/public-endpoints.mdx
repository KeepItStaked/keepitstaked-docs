# SEDA RPC/API Endpoints

- **RPC:** `{{ rpc }}`
- **API:** `{{ api }}`

## Purpose of Use

RPC, API, and gRPC endpoints provide multiple ways for external applications and services to interact with the blockchain. 

- **RPC:** Offers direct method invocation for querying and submitting transactions, enabling smooth integration and interaction with the blockchain.
  
- **API:** Allows developers to use standard HTTP requests to access blockchain data and execute commands, making it user-friendly and widely applicable in various applications.

- **gRPC:** Facilitates high-performance communication and streaming between services, offering better efficiency and support for multiple programming languages, ideal for complex applications needing real-time data exchange.

These interfaces enhance the interoperability, accessibility, and performance of blockchain interactions.
